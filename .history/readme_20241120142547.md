 Registration Project

This project is a registration system built using Node.js, Kafka, Redis, and PostgreSQL. It includes a Kafka producer-consumer setup, a Redis cache for storing data, and a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- Kafka (installed locally or running via Docker)
- Redis (installed locally or running via Docker)
- PostgreSQL (installed locally or via Docker)

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP file containing the project.
2. Extract the contents to a folder on your machine.

3. Install the dependencies:

   In the terminal, navigate to the project folder and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Setup

### Kafka

1. Make sure Kafka is running locally on `localhost:9092`. You can start Kafka using Docker, or if you have it set up locally, ensure it is running.

2. Kafka requires Zookeeper for managing distributed brokers. You can use Kafkaâ€™s bundled Zookeeper or set it up separately.

### Redis

1. Ensure Redis is running locally on `localhost:6379`. You can install Redis or use Docker to run it.

### PostgreSQL

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally or through Docker.
2. The default database in the code is `registration_db`. Ensure the necessary table `registration_info` exists or is created based on your needs.

## Running the Project

1. Start your services:
   - Start Kafka and Zookeeper.
   - Start Redis.
   - Start PostgreSQL.

2. Run the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. Start the Kafka consumer:

   ```bash
   node consumer.js
   ```

   This will start the consumer, which listens to Kafka topics for new messages.

4. The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can now test the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

### 1. `/redis` (GET)

This endpoint interacts with Redis to set and retrieve a key-value pair.

Example Response:

```plaintext
Value from Redis: John Doe
```

### 2. `/register` (POST)

This endpoint registers a new user and adds the data to PostgreSQL.

Request Body Example:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

Response Example:

```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully"
}
```

## Kafka Consumer

The `consumer.js` file listens to messages on Kafka and processes them when they arrive. It connects to the `my-topic` Kafka topic and prints the message received.

- Consumer connection details:
  - `clientId`: `my-app`
  - `groupId`: `test-group`
  - `broker`: `localhost:9092`
  - Topic: `my-topic`

## Redis Integration

The project uses Redis for caching user data. The `server.js` file connects to Redis to store and retrieve values. The `/redis` endpoint demonstrates setting a key-value pair in Redis.

### Redis Commands Used:
- `SET`: Store data in Redis.
- `GET`: Retrieve data from Redis.

## PostgreSQL Integration

The project connects to PostgreSQL using a `registration_db` database.

- The `registration_info` table holds user registration data (name, email).
- Modify the `server.js` to interact with the PostgreSQL database for additional functionality if needed.

## Dependencies

- express: Web framework for Node.js.
- redis: Redis client for Node.js.
- kafkajs: Kafka client for Node.js.
- pg: PostgreSQL client for Node.js.
- body-parser: Middleware for parsing request bodies.
